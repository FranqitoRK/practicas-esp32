## Traffic Light for ESP32
In this folder you will find two files very similar; the one called "semaforo.ino" is where I tried to have the right timing of a traffic light, and then just releasing the flag for the other core.

For the second file named after the previous "semaforo-final.ino" is where I add another traffic light to check if it works correctly.
